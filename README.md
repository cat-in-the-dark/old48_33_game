## YoBA.

In that city the only asphalt road is a bike path. How could it be possible worse? But hey, it could! This only asphalt road is occupied by selfish ladys with baby carriages, who totally ignore road signs. But they can't ignore YOU, riding on bike with near-sound speed! 

Try to complete bike cross as fast as you can, dodge ladys and conrtroll your pedaling by pressing Z and X in time!

## Controls:
Z, X - left \ right pedal
Left arrow, Right arrow - turn bike
Enter - switch intro, instructions etc
Esc - restart game

Engine: libgdx 
Language: scala 
Platform: Cross platform, required java runtime environment(jre). (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloa..) 

## From Siberia with love.
